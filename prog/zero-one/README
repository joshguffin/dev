A 0-1 Integer programming problem solver.  For 1 <= i <= N, let S_i be integers
and define a function F as

F = sum_i ( c_i + f_i s_i )

where 0 <= s_i <= S_i

and c_i = { 0 if s_i = 0, 1 otherwise };

Then for a desired quantity S, find the s_i that minimize s.  This program takes
a file consisting of lines of the form

# the desired size S
d <positive integer>

# entries s_i (first 'i' is the character i always)
i c_i s_i

# entries S_i ('c' for constraint)
c S_i
